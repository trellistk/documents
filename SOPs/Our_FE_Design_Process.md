# Our Design Proess

## Collect Information.

Undestanding the current situation.

1. Get to know the stakeholders
2. Get to know the product/service
3. Get to know the pain points for each of the stakeholders

This is very important. If you don't know the needs of all the users involved, you will miss the mark on your proposal.

See your [How to ask Questions](../Getting-Started/how_to_ask_questions.md) document for how to do you research.

See [How Nouri Feeds People](../How%20Nouri_Feeds_People.md) document for what we are currently doing. Don't forget to ask questions in case the above is outdated.

## Decide on an idea/problem to tackle
Do not create solutions for problems that are non-existent. Find the problem first, see if it's something that is feasible with your abilities, the team's abilities, the amount of bandwidth we have, and our tooling capabilities.

## Find your R.A.T (Riskiest Assumptions Test)
What would break your biggest assumption? If you don't know what your R.A.T. is, then you may be spinning your wheels for no reason. Find your R.A.T. and test to see if it would actually break your assumption and make your approach unusable. This way we spin our wheels less in the wrong direction.

## Outline how you're going to tackle the problem.
1. Break things down with milestones and steps/TODOs under each milestone

Example Front End Milestones:
- Research/Collection Phase
  - Collect branding items
  - Research about stakeholders and pain points
- Planning and validation Phase
  - Find and validate your RAT
- Wireframing Phase
  - Diagram the flow/interaction do you need to tackle
  - Determine, build and propose a possible layout
- Wireframing II Phase
  - The above plus application of feedback
  - Application of copy if applicable
- Mockup Phase
  - Addition of colors, pictures, etc.
- Receive Apply Feedback
  - Repeat as necessary

2. Outline a timeline as well

For each of the milestones above, create a [proposal](../Getting-Started/06_How_to_Submit_Proposals.md). Get each milestone done, proposes and approved before moving on to the next one.

Always add screenshots, images, and/or links to prototypes and explain your solution to your proposal.

Always add "before" images and descriptions in order to show how things will change.
