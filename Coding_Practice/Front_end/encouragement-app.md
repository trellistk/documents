# Vanilla JS Encouragement Application. Front End. Step 1
We want an application that will share happy thoughts from people to encourage them throughout the day.
For this project, the requirements are:
- [ ] Only work with vanilla javascript
- [ ] Only work with the Front end
- [ ] Only work within one file, your index.html file
- [ ] No need for any persistence for now
- [ ] Have a form that will take in a user's submission
- [ ] When a form is submitted, display the happy thought someone submitted on the page under the submit form
- [ ] If a user submits another happy thought, have that one display on top of the last happy thought
Hints:
- Some code may need to be loaded first. There are two places in an html file where javascript code can be placed.
- You need to use event listeners
- Forms have default actions that happen when you submit a form. You may need to prevent this
- Don't forget to clean up (event listeners) after yourself
- No need to do any fancy styling
- No css
