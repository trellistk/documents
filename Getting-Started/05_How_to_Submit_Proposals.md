# How to Submit Proposals

If you have new ideas, designs, features, pivots and other things that need approval, you are in the right place.

You can find existing Proposals in our GitHub Project [here](https://github.com/Trellis Toolkitmeals/documents/projects/1).

## Creating a New Proposal
1. Make sure you first understand how existing work and goals are and if there is already an effort to solve the problem you are trying to address.
2. Create your proposal [here](https://github.com/orgs/trellistk/projects/).
3. Make a copy of the template and use it as a guide to get you going. Try to follow the guide especially if it's your first time creating a proposal and bring in as much information as you can. This is one way proposals at work can be submitted for review and discussions.
4. Share your proposal in Slack and we'll discuss it from there.
