# SourceTree Installation Procedure

---

## Introduction

While working on the Trellis Toolkit Repositories we have addopted the practice of squashing our commits before rebasing. While there are many ways of completing this, we request that everyone uses [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to help visualize and assist with the rebase process.

If SourceTree is installed incorrectly, the result can cause issues with your authentication on the admin side. With this in mind we request that you follow the instructions to ensure you can ensure your code is processed in a more timely manner with minimal issues.
