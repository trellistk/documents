# How to ask questions

Don't just say, "it's not working," "I can't figure it out," or "How do I solve this?" Learning how to ask questions is an integral part of growing as a developer and learning how to work with a team. The better questions you ask, the better you can communicate in interviews and in the workplace.

So if asking a question is not like asking a question, ðŸ˜µ how do we ask questions?

## Asking a question is like presenting a report

You need to bring to the table all the information you can gather and present it in a way that can be easily understood by those you are soliciting help from.

### Example Outline One: A bug you are stuck on

- [ ] State what you are trying to do.
- [ ] State why you are trying to do this.
- [ ] State what should be happening if there was no bug.
- [ ] Write down, step by step, how to reproduce what is happening and what to look for to see the bug.
- [ ] State what is the result when this happens. Any error messages, bugs, share the messages and stack trace.
- [ ] If this was NOT happening before, what could have changed before then and now that could have contributed to this bug.
- [ ] What different hypothesis or possible leads have you had, why did you think to look for answers in that directions, how did you search for the answers, and where did they lead you?
- [ ] Are there any other possible avenues you haven't visited. What is blocking you from pursuing answers there?

## Why do we bother asking questions in this way?

Communication is very important when working in a team.

When you are asking for help, it is very beneficial to whoever is helping you to have all the information in their hands so that they know what is going on, and what you are thinking and seeing. This way they are not wasting their time going through what you have already gone through to try to figure things out OR they could even find a step you've missed because you were too close to the problem.

While going through the process of building your "question", you may not even need to present it to someone to get help.

Going through and writing out your problem in this way before you ask for help can also help you solve your own problem. We should know, we do it all the time!
