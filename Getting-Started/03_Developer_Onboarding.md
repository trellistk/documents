## Meetings
- We don't have regular meetings. Instead, we work asynchronously as much as possible. The ability to work asynchronously is also highly valued in many tech workplaces. Meetings tend to eat into productivity as they take a lot of time away from writing code and cause a lot of context switching.
- We communicate mostly through Slack and GitHub for specific issues.
- We do calls for pair programming, help with debugging, mentoring, 1:1 sessions, etc. as needed.

## When life happens or your priorities change
Let us know! Most of us have day jobs and other commitments. How much you commit is exactly up to you.
